# Chat-With-Website

ðŸ¤– Welcome to the Chatbot project powered by Streamlit, LangChain, and Google Generative AI! ðŸš€

## Tech Stack:

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): Python framework for building interactive web applications.
- [LangChain](https://github.com/Langchain/LangChain): Natural language processing library for context-aware responses.
- [Google Generative AI](https://cloud.google.com/ai): Advanced language models for conversational interactions.

## Project Overview:
Imagine chatting with a website to get instant answers to your questions! This project extracts information from a website using LangChain and Google Generative AI, allowing users to interact and ask questions based on the website's content.

## How It Works:
1. Users input a website URL.
2. LangChain processes the website content, and Google Generative AI provides context-aware responses.
3. Users can ask questions, and the chatbot responds based on the context provided by the website.
